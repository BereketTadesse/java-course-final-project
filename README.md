# java-course-final-project

Not sure what to make yet, but I know I'm making something with a GUI.
Made some classes that change the default look for the components.
May not be the best implementation and the feature is probably not needed,
but it's good practice and more efficient than trying to learn a new framework in a week

I've decided to make a sort of Contacts app. Not the most exciting thing but it's MUCH better than nothing
